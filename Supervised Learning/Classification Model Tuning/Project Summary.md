**Project Objective**: Create classifcation models to predict if a credit card customer will cancel their account then optimize using hyperparameter tuning.

**Data Description**: General information regarding credit card customers, including age, income, gender, credit card spending, education level, and time with bank.

**Techniques Used**: Logistic Regression, Bagging, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boost

**Libraries/Packages**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and xgboost

**Insights**: The type of customers most likely to cancel their credit cards, include customers with less frequent but more expensive transactions, customers with lower revolving balances, customers with fewer bank products, and inactive customers. It is recommended that the bank focus more on retaining customers most likely to keep using their credit cards rather than reducing customer attrition from customers most likely to cancel.
